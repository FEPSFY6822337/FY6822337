        This paper investigates how facial recognition technology works, and the issues that would be faced with its implementation in
        society. Although facial recognition technology is not yet accurate enough to be used for certain situations, it should eventually
        reach a level where it can be used effectively. However, many issues may arise with its implementation, as data privacy and security
        concerns increase, which could lead to a more technologically dystopian society.

        As technology advances, people are constantly for new technology that can be incorporated easily and works efficiently. One of these
        technologies is facial recognition technology (FRT), which is a way of identifying individuals via real-time video/images of their
        faces. 
        Individual’s faces are scanned via a camera, which is then analysed by an algorithm that deciphers a subject’s facial dimensions.
        The algorithm typically focuses on the size and relationship between individual features (such as the shape of the eye socket, the
        distance between eyes, the shape of the jaw, and so on) (Fussey, P., Davies, B. and Innes, M. 2020). The data analysed by the 
        algorithm is then matched to a database containing other data about facial structures to find a possible match. 
        Although facial recognition technology is said to have gained a massive increase in accuracy between the period of 2013-2018, 
        therefore its accuracy and use in mass public places can still be questionable (Lai, X. and Patrick Rau, P.-L. 2021).

        There are many ways facial recognition can be implemented in society and many ways it is currently implemented, especially in recent
        times (2018 and onwards). 
        Facial recognition can currently be seen in use on certain smartphones as a security measure, such as the iPhones released after the
        iPhone 8.  It can also be seen used in public places in countries such as Russia, China, India and South Korea. These countries
        implemented facial recognition technology during the COVID-19 pandemic to enforce quarantine, trace potential contacts with COVID-19
        carriers and monitor fevers (Roussi, A. 2020). In January 2020, a city-wide surveillance system using live facial recognition
        software developed by NtechLab was successfully implemented and used across the whole of Moscow (Roussi, A. 2020). China is also
        known for its extensive use of facial recognition technology in public places for security and tracking of “criminals” by the 
        government, but recently due to COVID-19, facial recognition technology such as thermal facial recognition and masked facial
        recognition has seen use in small businesses such as local stores and restaurants (Su, Z. et al. 2022).
        Facial recognition could be utilised further and instead of just being used for smartphone security, it could also be used for
        banking security and identification for healthcare. It could also be rolled out in public and used for policing and keeping security
        in public places, much like China. However, for this to be implemented, many issues need to be overcome, especially if they are to be
        implemented in the UK

  <h3 id="Issue with facial recognition and how it works">Issue with facial recognition and how it works</h3>

      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>


        One main issue with facial recognition technology is accuracy. The accuracy can depend on how the facial recognition technology
        works. If the algorithm uses an image/video, many issues may occur, such as bad lighting, bad colouring and positioning of a person's
        face. In 2018 a study done by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru showed that certain advanced facial recognition software failed to
        identify people of colour 35% of the time, compared to a 1% fail rate for Caucasian people. Researchers at the University of Essex
        in Colchester also carried out an experiment, where facial recognition made only 8 correct matches out of 42 attempts (Crawford, K. 2019).
        These errors could occur in picture/video facial recognition software due to bad lighting, where features of a 
        face are difficult to pick out. 
        “FindFace” developed by Ntechlab, is an example of a video/picture facial recognition software. The algorithm detects faces and the 
        position of the head to correct for distortions using 3d vectors. It then looks for certain facial features and their placements and
        then maps them out onto the vector. Afterwards, it compares the values and facial features to other values and facial features on its
        database to find a % match probability (the higher the % the higher the chance that the face is a match) (Face detection, verification
        and recognition technology) If there is bad lighting, shading and facial positions, not enough data and facial features could be 
        collected to make a high % facial match, and errors could be made.
        A more accurate method of facial recognition software can be seen used in Apple iPhones, where depth data and an infrared image are used.
        Rather than taking data from a normal image/video, the phone projects thousands of invisible dots on your face to create a depth map, 
        and captures an infrared image (About face ID advanced technology – apple support). This eliminates the issue of lighting as the image
        it is capturing is infrared, and it is why you can unlock your iPhone using face ID when it is pitch black. However, as this method is
        scanning your face directly, rather than an image of your face, it cannot be used for CCTVs in general crowded areas, and rather has
        to be used up close. This could be used to identify people for banking and healthcare issues if the person is unresponsive, but then 
        there arises the issue of security and privacy. 
        However, if everything starts using the same face recognition software there could be issues with data leaks. Although it may be more
        secure to use face identification, data leaks could have your face and face structure leaked, which is concerning for privacy and security
        matters, as people could use this information to access anything that is protected via face identification.
        Another issue would be privacy issues, if private companies start implementing facial recognition software, the storing of that data
        and the potential selling of that data can be a huge risk and privacy breach. Breaches of data privacy can be seen in China, where 
        facial recognition software is currently present and used by private companies, as the public and the government are unsure as to 
        where people's images and data are stored (Su, Z. et al. 2022). If facial recognition were to be implemented in the UK and other 
        societies, laws such as the Data Protection Act (DPA) (for the UK) or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (for the EU) need
        to be updated and regulated, which will also cause mass political debate and divide.
