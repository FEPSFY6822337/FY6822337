        This paper investigates how facial recognition technology works, and the issues that would be faced with its implementation in
        society. Although facial recognition technology is not yet accurate enough to be used for certain situations, it should eventually
        reach a level where it can be used effectively. However, many issues may arise with its implementation, as data privacy and security
        concerns increase, which could lead to a more technologically dystopian society.

      <pre>
        As technology advances, people are constantly for new technology that can be incorporated easily and works efficiently. One of these
        technologies is facial recognition technology (FRT), which is a way of identifying individuals via real-time video/images of their
        faces. 
        Individual’s faces are scanned via a camera, which is then analysed by an algorithm that deciphers a subject’s facial dimensions.
        The algorithm typically focuses on the size and relationship between individual features (such as the shape of the eye socket, the
        distance between eyes, the shape of the jaw, and so on) (Fussey, P., Davies, B. and Innes, M. 2020). The data analysed by the 
        algorithm is then matched to a database containing other data about facial structures to find a possible match. 
        Although facial recognition technology is said to have gained a massive increase in accuracy between the period of 2013-2018, 
        therefore its accuracy and use in mass public places can still be questionable (Lai, X. and Patrick Rau, P.-L. 2021).
